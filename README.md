## WELCOME TO MEMORY CASTLE ##

Memory Castle is a 2 player game in the memory/concentration style with a fantasy hero theme.

Memory Castle was written in 48 hours, a number of which were spent editing images badly (thanks 
Matt for demonstrating how to edit images not-badly). There are many more features planned for 
version 2, aniticipated for release shortly. For now, we operate in true startup style and ship 
this ~~crappy, partly finished version~~ MVP in order to let users guide the future development 
of the game. Or possibly because the project deadline is now.

### TECHNOLOGIES ###
Memory Castle is purely front end, written in javascript without the aid of any useful frameworks. 
Why, you ask? Our course instructors here are cruel beings who delight in forcing students to 
"learn the fundamentals properly" and who do not tolerate crappily hacked together code.

Common js libraries including jQuery and underscore were employed because built in DOM manipulation 
is for suckas and _.sample is my fave. Git/GitHub are used for version control. Browser localStorage 
is employed to retain high scores locally.

The page is deployed via GitHub Pages at: https://philipcastiglione.github.io/concentration/
